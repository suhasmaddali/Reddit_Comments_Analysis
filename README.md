# Reddit Comment Analysis 

Understanding the comments that are posted in Reddit could be quite useful especially if one wants to understand some important discussions and their polarity. 
It would be good if we are using the text and looking at various features and important words to get to know the context in which we are using the machine learning models for prediction respectively. With the aid of data visualization, we are going to understand the different text components and important features that are present in the text, therefore, getting to know the overall context. 

We see that there are different comments that are being generated everyday. It is important that we understand those comments and classify them so that it becomes easy for others to distinguish the text components and understand the ways at which different things are working accordingly. 

Using wordcloud, we can get to know the frequency of the words that we are taking and this would ensure that we understand the text accordingly. When we are looking at the size of the words, we can get to know the frequency of the occurrence of different words that we are taking into consideration respectively. With the aid of machine learning and text analysis, we are going to understand the text and get to know the different words that are present in reddit. This would ensure that different machine learning and deep learning models are applied and the prediction for different parameters generated respectively.

We first read the data that is stored in pandas dataframe. Once we get an understanding of the dataframe, we are going to be using different machine learning approaches to solve the problem and get the best predictions for the test set respectively. 

With the help of various libraries in python, we would be able to visualize various examples and understand the different text that is present along with the polarity of it respectively. Therefore, we are going to be performing the machine learning analysis and data visualization, thus, understanding the overall text and the polarity present in it respectively. 

When we are taking different comments from reddit and analysing some of the comments, we could find some insights from the data that could really be useful and meaningful for different machine learning purposes respectively. With the aid of data visualization, the comments from reddit could be analyzed and understood. When we are learning the different set of tools, the better would the machine learning models perform on the test set. We are gaining a good understnading of the machine learning models and we are learning the things that we are going to be doing the things that we are learning the things that we are doing the things that re somethings that we are going to be using for the long term. We are sure that the more we ar elearning the things that we are going to get in the long term, the better we are going to be using the machine learning models for predictions.
