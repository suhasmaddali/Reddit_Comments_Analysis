# Reddit Comment Analysis 

It would be good if we are using the text and looking at various features and important words to get to know the context in which we are using the machine learning models for prediction respectively. With the aid of data visualization, we are going to understand the different text components and important features that are present in the text, therefore, getting to know the overall context. 

Using machine learning, we are going to be performing the analysis and understand some important features which inturn ensures that we get the best accurate results in the test set respectively. Using machine learning, we are going to be using the different machine learning models and this ensures that we are geting the best outputs in the test set respectively. 

We see that there are different comments that are being generated everyday. It is important that we understand those comments and classify them so that it becomes easy for others to distinguish the text components and understand the ways at which different things are working accordingly. 

Using wordcloud, we can get to know the frequency of the words that we are taking and this would ensure that we understand the text accordingly. When we are looking at the size of the words, we can get to know the frequency of the occurence of different words that we are taking into consideration respectively. 

With the aid of machine learning and text analysis, we are going to understand the text and get to know the different words that are present in reddit. This would ensure that different macihne learning and deep learning models are applied and the prediction for different parameters be predicted respectively.

We first read the data that is stored in pandas dataframe. Once we get an understanding of the dataframe, we are going to be using different machine learning approaches to solve the problem and get the best predictions for the test set respectively.
